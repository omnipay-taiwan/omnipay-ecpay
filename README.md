PHP 5.3+. This package implements ecpay support for Omnipay.

**Note:** Replace `omnipay-taiwan`, `recca0120`, `recca0120`, `recca0120@gmail.com`, `ecpay`
, `:package_description` and `ecpay` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md)
, [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)
and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
